Change Log:

        v2.1.0-alpha
            - the assembler is done for the most part, macro implementation is left
            - several directives still need to be implemented
            - #include needs to be implemented
            - testing needs to be conducted, it has only been minorly tested since v2.0.3-pre-alpa
    Legacy:
        v1.0.1-beta
            - Second Debug() parameter, if true, the output can be parsable by v1 ParseLASM
